            <h2>Beaches</h2>
            <p>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The
                particles composing a
                beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources,
                such as
                mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on
                the
                local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.
